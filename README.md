[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/44990f03-16ca-455b-85de-9a42377ede45/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/passfort-tech-test-danielle/deploys)

Re-usable React component for dropdown that makes use of existing libraries to display a flexible dropdown with search functionality.

Some of the designs are not implemented due to the limitations/complexities of the 3rd party library I chose, I didn't want to re-invent the wheel in this case especially as I wasn't going to be spending over 2 hours on this technical test, and I didn't have time to deep-dive into the library to get it perfect.

There are some caveats and intentions written in the helper functions.
